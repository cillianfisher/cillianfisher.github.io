## About Me

Hello! My name is Cillian Fisher.

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science (BS) in Finance at Lehigh Universityâ€™s School of Business, finishing my undergrad in the Spring of 2024. I am highly motivated with excellent communication and organization skills and a passion for business. Additionally, I have strong decision making and analytical skills and am excited to showcase them in my future career.

I plan to pursue a 1 year MS in Business Analytics at Lehigh University after completing my bachelors degree this year. By doing so, I'll be able to enhance my understanding of analytical tools and their application to the business world.

_**[Data Science Project Using 10-k Filings](report)**_


In this project, I analyze the sentiment of S&P 500 companies' 10-K filings to predict stock price movements. By quantifying positive and negative sentiments, I explore their correlation with market performance. This approach aims to offer investors a novel tool for informed decision-making based on textual analysis of corporate disclosures.

## Career Objectives

Based on my time at Lehigh as well as my experience workign at Northwestern Mutual, I have a general idea of what I'd like to do in my career. This Summer, I'll be interning at a startup at the NASDAq Center in San Francisco, where I'll be working as a brand equity intern at a startup named 'The AutoNinjas'. 

I believe that through my past experiences as well as the experiences I am going to have, I'm capable of being in a role that combines a financial role with an emphasis on business analytics.
